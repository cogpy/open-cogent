# üëã Open-Agent

> **Open-source alternative to Claude Agent SDK, ChatGPT Agents, and Manus.**

Agentic AI systems, such as Claude Agent SDK (Claude Code) or ChatGPT Agents, can perform meaningful real-world tasks by operating computers, browsers, and phones just like humans. Open source would enhance their capabilities.

[**Open-Agent.io**](http://open-agent.io/) is an open Agentic AI you can use or modify. Chat with cutting-edge models while our multi-agent system completes your tasks.

Play with it, deploy it, enhance it, or use it as the foundation for your next dedicated agent. We welcome all contributions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üí° Idea**  
  Have your own highly customizable Agentic AI that integrates OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and open-source models to work together seamlessly!

- **üí¨ Stop prompt-chasing. Start decision-making**  
  Spec & context engineering give agents structure to plan, score, and surface options. You stay in control of the final call. Achieve more, struggle less.

- **üîî Multi-agent collaboration**  
  Instead of chatting with a single AI, all the frontier models collaborate together to finish your task with our multi-agent framework.

- **üè† Self-hostable**  
  Open source and free to modify.
